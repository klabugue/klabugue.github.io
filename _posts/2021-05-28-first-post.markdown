This is my first post! I thought I'd take down some notes about Computer Vision basics and how we could think about images as functions. Here are some key takeaways:

*  An image can be defined as a function; you could think of an image as a 2D object within an XY axis and with an certain intensity at each point in the coordinate system, f:R^2->R
* A color image can also be defined as a function, f: R^2->R^3, with chanels r, g, b
