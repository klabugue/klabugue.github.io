DevOps is something a lot of developers seem to want to stay away from..but given the fact that Agile is such a dominating practice these days, I think it's a good idea to become familiar with DevOps tools such as GitLab.

That being said, I wanted to document some of the progress I make while learning about GitLab so I added some new tags -- #devops and #gitlab -- which I'll being using to document some lessons I learn while deploying my first GitLab CI/CD pipeline for a school project I'm working on here (https://gitlab.com/klabugue/optimus-prime/).
